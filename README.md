###### Disclaimer

I haven't been able to create developer's account to upload this extension on Chrome webstore, due to the lack of availability of a Credit Card at my disposal. So the extension is still not live yet.
Adding to the above mentioned reason, I also believe that this extension isn't mature enough or doesn't have enough functionality to be put on webstore.
I am currently working on a feature to add three font sizes as an option for the user to chose. Currently I am stuck on the asynchronous nature of user input. Once I have fixed that, maybe I will upload the extension.
